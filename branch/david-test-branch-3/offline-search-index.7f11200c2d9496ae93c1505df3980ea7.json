Please ensure that you’ve done some research to ensure you select the appropriate model, BOM, hardware, firmware and software combination.  To build your own index you will need to acquire the items listed on the BOM. This includes various mechanical components along with a significant number of 3D printed parts. When printing the 3d parts, be sure to print them with the recommended settings.\nTools The following tools are needed to build the Index.\n 2mm Allen Key 2.5mm Allen Key 3mm Allen Key 4mm Allen Key Fine Tip Tweezers (for positioning T-Nuts) Pliers / Vice Grips Utility Knife / Precision Blade  Tips \u0026 Tricks When assembling the Index, the following tips will help the process go more smoothly.\n Clean up your 3D prints well. Make sure that you have removed any support material, and have cleaned up the edges of any holes. Test that you can fit the V-Slot or machine screw for a specific part into the hole. Deburr the aluminum profile at the ends. Then it’s easier to put parts together. Positioning Slot Nuts can be a bit of a challenge. A simple way to get them into the right place is to use gravity to get them close, and then use either the long end an allen key or a pair of fine tipped tweezers to push or pull them to the exact position. Inserting Belts can be easier if you move the gantry you’re inserting the belt into to the middle of the rail it is on and then as you insert the belt, move it away from the side you want the belt to come out from. The v-slot will catch the belt and once you’ve moved the gantry a little bit, you will be able to catch the belt. Passing a belt through a belt slot from the inner side can be easier if you place an exacto knife blade at the back side of the slot and butt the belt against that while drawing it up through the slot. Press Fit Nuts are used in several places. If your printer tolerances make it so these nuts don’t stay in you can use a piece of tape over the back to hold them in temporarily.

This is not an absolute guarantee that the connection to the STM32 works though.

It’s correct operation is important for normal operation of the DFU. Wrong frequency and / or incorrect load capacitors can cause issues.  Alternative method to upload: This method requires an ST-Link (V2 Clone or equivalent). Additionally you need the software STM32CubeProgrammer by ST.

Insert a M3 Hex Nut vertically into the slot near the adjustment slot on the X gantry back.     Tighten an M3 x 12mm screw into the Hex Nut installed in the previous step.     Insert an M3 Hex Nut into one of the hex nut locations on the X gantry front and push into the 3d print.     Pull the hex nut fully into location by screwing a M3x12mm machine screw into it from the opposite side of the X gantry back. Then unscrew the M3x12mm machine screw.\n  Repeat steps 6-7 for the remaining five M3 nut locations.     Insert a M5 nut into the M5 nut location at the bottom of the X front gantry     Insert a M5x45mm machine screw into each of the top two holes on the X Gantry Front which have a printed roller spacer.     Onto each of the two machine screws placed in the previous step, place a V-slot roller     Place the X gantry rear onto the two machine screws     Add a M5 nylon lock onto each of the two machine screws     Tighten the nylon lock nuts on the machine screws so that the two sides are snug against the V-slot rollers.\n  Place a Linear Rail onto the X gantry front and line up the holes with the three holes on the left.     Place an M3x12mm machine screw into each of the holes and tighten to attach the linear rail.     Repeat steps 15-16 for the right side linear rail.     Place the NEMA 17 motor so the shaft runs through the X gantry front and emerges on the same side as the linear rails.     Fasten the NEMA17 motor to the X gantry front using four M3x8mm machine screws.     At the top left of the assembly front, place a limit switch PCB     Fasten the limit switch PCB with two M3x8mm screws.     Place a M5x45mm machine screw through the GT2 idler, the z axis roller spacer and into the X gantry front.     Secure this machine screw to the gantry by tightening it into M5 nut inserted in step 9.\n  Place the GT2 Pulley onto the motor shaft and use some belt to adjust the height to match the idler.     Tighten the pulley into place using the grub screws.\n  To the left linear rail attach the Z Gantry Left using four M3x6mm Machine Screws.\n  To the right linear rail attach the mirrored Z Gantry Left using four M3x6mm Machine Screws.\n  Ensure the 3.3V power supply is off.\n  Connect the black wire from the limit switch to the 3.3V power source ground or negative terminal\n  Connect the red wire from the limit switch to the 3.3V power source positive terminal.\n  Power on the 3.3V power supply\n  Move the right side gantry to the top so that it triggers the limit switch (which illuminates an LED)\n  Move the left side gantry to the bottom extent of travel.\n  Take the GT2 belt and insert one end so that just under half the teeth on the top of the left side gantry are gripping the teeth on the belt.\n  Pull the belt towards the motor pulley and then around the pulley\n  Ensure the belt is taut and insert into the teeth on the right side gantry (mirrored Z Gantry Left)\n  Continue to direct the belt down towards the idler and around\n  Direct the belt back to the left gantry and pull taught.\n  Place over the teeth at the side of the gantry and determine a cut location on the belt\n  Cut the belt so that you can insert into the teeth of the gantry part\n  Insert the teeth into the gantry part ensuring that the belt it taut\n  ","categories":"","description":"X Gantry Assembly\n","excerpt":"X Gantry Assembly\n","ref":"/index/branch/david-test-branch-3/docs/mechanical-assembly/x-gantry/","tags":"","title":"X Gantry"},{"body":"At the moment we support two sets of tools: A Placement Head and a Paste Dispensing Head (coming soon).\nNecessary Components  Placement Head: 1x NEMA11 Motor 4x M2.5x8mm Screws 1x Pneumatic Fitting (6mm OD Tube and M5 Thread) 1x CP40 Nozzle Holder  Assembly Depending on the tools you intend to have on your Index, follow the appropriate instructions below.\nPlacement head  Attach the Pneumatic fitting and the CP40 Nozzle Holder to the NEMA11 motor Use four M2.5x8mm screws to attach the NEMA11 Motor with the shaft facing down.
